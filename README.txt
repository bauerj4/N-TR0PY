ABOUT
======================================================================

N-TR0PY is an n-body collisionless Boltzmann solver written by Jacob
Bauer during the time he was at Cavendish Laboratory. It is written
in C/C++ and is MPI parallelized. The intention of the solver is to
perform galactic structure simulations in different cosmologies. It
uses the Barnes-Hut KDK (kick-drift-kick) method by default, but for
instructional purposes will implement high order Runge-Kutta codes
and a DKD (drift-kick-dift) method to demonstrate the potency of KDK.
